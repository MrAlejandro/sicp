```lisp
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess 
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)
    )
)

(define (good-enough? guess x)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001)
)

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (improve guess x)
    (average guess (/ x guess))
)

(define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2)
)

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)
    )
)

(sqrt-iter 1.0 2)
```

Using the custom `if` operator (or rather procedure `new-if`) will fall into an infinite loop, because it uses applicative order evaluation, so it first evaluate the `predicate`, then `then-clause`, and finally `else-clause` before even executing `new-if`, but since the `else-clause` contains the recursive call, it will fall into an ininite loop. On the other hand the built in `if` special operator behaves differently, it evaluates the whole expression, passed as predicate `(good-enough? guess x)` first, and only then proceedes with execution of proper branch.
