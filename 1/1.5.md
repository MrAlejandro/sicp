```lisp
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0)
        0
        y
    )
)

(test 0 (p))
```
As scheme is applicative evaluation language, it will first evaluate the 0, no problems here it just yield 0, but then it will try evaluating `(p)`  and according to `p`'s definition it will fall into an infinite loop.

It scheme were normal (or lazy) evaluating language, the `p` procedure would never be called, so the result would be 0.
